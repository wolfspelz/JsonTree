JSON  Tree
==========

If you just want to extract values from JSON with single line C# expressions then use the newer project [JsonPath](https://github.com/wolfspelz/JsonPath). JsonTree has a deserializer and a serializer. The parser/deserializer is a bit behind the curve compared to [JsonPath](https://github.com/wolfspelz/JsonPath). You probably won't need the serializer anyway. 

This is what you want:
* [JsonPath github](https://github.com/wolfspelz/JsonPath)
* [JsonPath nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JsonPath)
